# CommonGUI to Go

This is a collection of scripts that facilitate working with docker images and containers. This repo is adapted to quickly retrieve and use a running commonGUI.

**Attention** Changes inside the container do not persist and are gone as soon as a new container is created. If you want any updates to persist, use the devel images with locally mounted directories to develop and generate a new release image from your changes. Please refer to the [usage documentation](doc/020_Usage.md) for further infos.

## Preperation:

##### 1. install docker
Please install Docker according to the [010_Setup_Docker.md](doc/010_Setup_Docker.md) or by executing the [install_docker.bash](tools/install_docker.bash) script.

##### 2. login to registry
The docker development is based on different docker image setup steps. For this repo a release image with an installed commonGUI is available on the internal docker registry. Please login with your DFKI credentials as follows (requires VPN connection):

```bash
    docker login d-reg.hb.dfki.de
```

In order to check for available images you can browse the DFKI [internal registry](https://d-reg.hb.dfki.de/repositories) (Login required).

## Get GUI

```bash
    # create working directory
    mkdir -p ~/docker/commonGUI && cd ~/docker/commonGUI
    # clone repo
    git clone https://git.hb.dfki.de/ndlcom/docker_image-commongui.git .
    # generate container and start commonGUI with CommonConfig
    ./commonGUI.bash
```

##### HINTS:

* For starting with another xml config execute (suffix may be omitted): `./commonGUI.bash CommonGUI <Config>`

* To see, which configs are available execute: `./commonGUI.bash CommonGUI`

* In order to get tab completion for commonGUI.bash: `source autocomplete.me`
