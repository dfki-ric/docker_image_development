# Docker Development 

These scripts are helping to set up a docker-based development and release workflow.

**Requisite:** Please install Docker according to the [README_Docker.md](README_Docker.md)!

The docker development is based on different docker image setup steps, some of which can be omitted when a local registry is set up and the required image is already available.

In order to check for available images you can browse the DFKI [internal registry](https://d-reg.hb.dfki.de/repositories) (Login required).

# Running

* Clone this repository
* Login to the docker registry containing the images (if not on dockerhub and registry available)
  * See [README_Docker.md](README_Docker.md)

## For the lazy

0. Install docker, login to registry to pull existing image (see above)

1. Clone repo

2. Execute `./exec.bash` to start CommonGUI with CommonConfig

3. Done.

For starting with another xml config execute: ./exec.bash CommonGUI <Config>

## In general

In order to initialize, run or attach to containers you will be using the `./exec.bash` script.
You can use either base, devel or release as argument in order to determine which image you want to base your container on.
Per default the exec.bash script will drop into the CommonGUI with CommonConfig.xml with the default mode set in the settings.bash if no other arguments are given.

In order to pull images you need to be logged in at the docker registry.

When the default execmode is set correctly in the settings.basg sctipt, you can omit the mode (devel,release) after `./exec.bash`.


## When a release image is available:

* call `$> ./exec.bash release STARTSCRIPT`
  * STARTSCRIPT here is a script from the image, with a high probability of also being in the startscritps folder of this repo
  * The image will be pulled automatically
* Optional: call `$> source autocomplete.me` to have code completion after ./exec.bash
  * This will use the completion with the scripts in this repo, new scripts might nor be available inside the image
    * Possibly reset this repo to the date of the release image to improve this situation

## When no release image is available:

In case you got a release as tar.gz file, you can load the release locally using the instructions provided with the file.

### Use a devel image:

In case you have to create a release image you can use a "devel image".

* call `$> ./exec.bash devel`
  * follow the instructions on first start (most probably: call /opt/setup_workspace.bash)
  * this creates a mounted home and workspace folder in this folder
    * they are mounted as the users home and /opt/workspace folders in the container
    * you can edit files by using your host system and compile using the console created with `$> ./exec.bash devel`
      * TIP: in case you are using VSCode also check out the "Remote - Containers" extension
   
To create a release image, have a look at the [release image Readme](image_setup/03_release_image/Readme.md)!

Change the default execmode in settings.bash to release and push this repo

## When no devel image is available:

You are the one initially creating the images for your project.

### Create a devel image

* fork this repo to your projects namespace or into a new group using the git web interface.
  * This way, changes and updates can be tracked and updated more easily in both directions.
* clone your fork to your system into your desired folder
  * git clone https://git.hb.dfki.de/MY_PROJECT/docker_development MY_PROJECT_FOLDER

* edit the settings.bash 
  * set a new project name
  * select the base image to use
  * set your registry (empty if none)

* edit the image_setup/02_devel_image/setup_workspace.bash and make it work
  * in the docker container it is mounted as /opt/setup_workspace.bash
  * call `$> ./exec.bash base`
  * call `bash /opt/setup_workspace.bash` to test your workspace setup (clone repos, etc.) until it works
* edit the image_setup/02_devel_image/Dockerfile
  * Add all additionally installed packages to the apt-get line
    * For rock and ros there are helper scripts to determine the os dependencies of the workspace in the image\_setup/02\_devel_image folder. Copy them to your workspace folder if you want to use them from the container.
  * Add possibly needed commands needed to make your code run in this container
  
To create a devel image, have a look at the [devel image Readme](image_setup/02_devel_image/Readme.md).

* Change the default execmode in settings.bash to devel and push this repo

## When no base images are available:

You are the one initally creating the images for your registry, or you don't have one

* go to the image_setup/01_base_images folder
* call the build scritps you need base images for
* if you have a registry, push them

Also see the [base image Readme](image_setup/01_base_images/Readme.md).



# Distribute a release image Image

You can build archives with image and scripts in order to deploy to targets that don not have access to your registry

See the [save release Readme](image_setup/04_save_release/Readme.md).




## Attach More Bashes or Start More Programs

Each subsequent call to exec.bash is using the same container

You can attach more bashes to the container using the exec.bash command again

```./exec.bash```

```./exec.bash devel```

etc.

## Updating an image from registry

You can cd into the tools folder andf call `update_image.bash` this updated the image of the current default exec mode.
Call `update_image.bash [base|devel|release]` to update other images

## Refreshing the container

This should not be needed, but is somtimes requires for testing.
The easiest way is to delete the accorting *-container_id.txt file.
The container will be re-created on the next call of exec.

THe same happens when you update the image by pulling


# Special Topics

## Changing a release without devel folders
In case you need to change parts of an existing release, you can:

* extract a release to a devel workspace using the script in the tools folder
   * You need to generate a devel image or have access to it in the registry
   * change the default execmode or use `./exec.bash devel`
   * use the devel mode to do the changes
   * build a new release
* Edit the code within the container
  *  Changes are lost when the container is deleted/refreshed or "docker commit"the changes



## Using iceccd in the container

Note: This has not been thoroughly tested. But feel free to try and provide feedback.

### Step 1 (option a)

Iceccd in the container has problems to find the iceccd server. To solve this, you have to modify the config file  `/etc/icecc/icecc.conf` to set `ICECC_SCHEDULER_HOST`to the address of the scheduler. 

### Step 1 (option b)

When starting your container, use the flag  `--net=host` so that host and container share the same network interfaces.

### Step 2

Stop the iceccd daemon on your host with

```
sudo service iceccd stop
```

and restart it in the container

```
sudo service iceccd restart
```

It should be possible to have more complex setups for the iceccd in containers/hosts. So that not necessarily the host has to stop using icecc or multiple container can make use of it.

## Programming in a Rock environemnt with Docker and VScode

You can edit code, compile and debug in your container from a host using the remote development package from VScode. Once you have your container created and visual studio with the [remote development extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed in your host you can access your containers for development with this extension.

Another useful extension for vscode to work with Rock is the [rock extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rock-robotics.rock). This tool gives you access to the most common autoproj commands directly from the vscode interface.
