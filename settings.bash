# In case your docker container needs special run paramaters
# like open ports, additional mounts etc.
# When you change this, you need to recreate the container
# best way to do this, run the delete_contianer.bash script
# often used params:
# --dns-search=mydomain
# --net=host
# --privileged
# -v /dev/input/:/dev/input
# -v $HOME/.Xauthority:/home/devel/.Xauthority #mount the .Xauthority file, if the GUI shall be forwarded through ssh Xforwarding

# mount ccache volume, if enabled, a volume name based on the base image name is generated

# and enable ccache for your builds
